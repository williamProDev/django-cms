# Why this app?

- Read https://github.com/divio/aldryn-sso/issues/45
- sometimes, when login in via Divio, aldryn-sso complains about `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "backend_auth_user_email_key"` 
- in that case you need the aldryn-sso admin panel to connect the exising user to your custom user model
- you're welcome!
