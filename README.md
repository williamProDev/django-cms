This is a generic django CMS project example which includes the necessary CMS plugins for an average website and a production-ready frontend configuration (webpack5 + scss + typescript + vue + live reloading for development).

The project can be deployed to any dockerized environment. By default we maintain [a divio.com setup guide](/docs/divio-deployment-setup.md).

It's also possible to run this project out of the box, you can clone it and follow [the local setup instructions](/docs/local-setup-instructions.md) to try it out.
