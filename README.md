This is a production-ready cutting-edge dockerized django CMS project example. It includes the necessary CMS plugins for an average website and a solid webpack configuration (webpack5 + scss + typescript + vue + live reloading for development).

The project can be deployed to any dockerized environment. We provide a well-tested [divio.com setup guide](/docs/divio-deployment-setup.md). Besides that we've successfully deployed it to heroku before and the skeleton config for it can be found on the [respective branch](https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-template/tree/heroku).

It's also possible to run this project locally out of the box, you can clone it and follow [the local setup instructions](/docs/local-setup-instructions.md) to try it out.
